# About Me

Hey there! I'm Joey, a fullstack developer based in Texas. My web development journey started with React.js and Node.js, and since then I've been hooked on the dynamic world of creating meaningful applications.

While primarily focusing on React.js and Node.js, I've also delved into Ruby on Rails. Eager to explore new technologies and expand my skill set, I find joy in building applications, from designing interactive interfaces to implementing robust backend functionality.

Beyond coding, I enjoy playing basketball with my kids, experimenting with recipes in the kitchen, and diving into captivating books. In my developer journey, I'm actively seeking backend web development opportunities. I'm enthusiastic about learning new languages and technologies and am drawn to roles where I can contribute to a tight-knit team and make an impact.

If you're into web development and looking for a dedicated team member with a knack for problem-solving, let's connect! I'm open to new challenges and ready to contribute to exciting projects.
